# **limitless_tsf**

`limitless_tsf` is an open-source time series forecasting library aimed at democratizing access to high-quality forecasting tools and challenging the status quo of expensive and arcane demand planning solutions offered by enterprise software giants like SAP APO, Kinaxis, Blue Yonder, O9 Solutions etc.

With `limitless_tsf`, companies can take control of their time series forecasting needs without relying on costly or difficult-to-integrate proprietary software.

## **About**

`limitless_tsf` is built to make advanced time series forecasting techniques accessible, scalable, and easy to implement. Whether you're a small business owner or part of a large enterprise, `limitless_tsf` provides tools that can help you forecast sales, inventory, production, or any other time-dependent data.

It was created in response to the need for a **cost-effective alternative** to the complex and expensive demand planning solutions, which are often inaccessible to small and medium-sized businesses.

By offering a **user-friendly interface** and a suite of modern time series forecasting models, `limitless_tsf` can help organizations make more accurate predictions with minimal effort.
